# Nomenclature

## Expressions

Expressions are a combination of terms and operators which evaluate to a single value, for example:

=== "Template"
    ```erb
    <%= 5 * 2 / 10 %>
    ```
=== "Output"
    ```
    1
    ```

## Statements

Statements are commands given to the template language interpreter to do something, e.g. output the value of an expression, or execute a for loop.
