# Views basics

Rwf comes with a [templating](templates/) library that can generate dynamic pages. Dynamic templates allow you to generate unique HTML pages on the fly, and libraries like [Turbo](turbo) can use it in a way that feels like a native frontend application.

## What are views?

Views are the **V** in MVC: they control what your users see and how they experience your web app. Separating views from [controllers](../controllers/) allows them to reuse similar parts of your web app on different pages.


## Using JavaScript frontends

If you prefer to build your frontend with JavaScript libraries like React or Vue, take a look at Rwf's [REST](../controllers/REST/) API documentation. While useful, Rwf templates are not required to build web applications.
